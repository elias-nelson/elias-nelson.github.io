I specialize in digital soil mapping, geostatistical modeling, and machine learning, with a deep focus on the R programming language, though I also enjoy working with Python, Julia, HTML, and CSS. This space is designed to showcase the tools and techniques that have been essential to me in managing data and leveraging technology effectively. My posts are grounded in open-source resources, lowering the financial barrier to adoption, with the goal of building your intellectual capital.\n\nIn addition to sharing knowledge, I am also taking on independent consulting projects. If you're looking for assistance with a data-driven project, feel free to reach out—I’d love to collaborate.\n:::\n:::\n:::\n",
