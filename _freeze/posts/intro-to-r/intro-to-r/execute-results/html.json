Sure, I could write some code and get results (output), but that didn’t mean I truly understood what `R` could *do* or how powerful it really is. I realized I never had a proper introduction to the language.\n\nOften, experts skip over details they assume are ‘obvious’—but things are only obvious once you're familiar with them. In my case, I felt like I’d been thrown into the deep end with `R`, missing the foundational understanding that would have made everything else click.\n\nDespite this rocky start, my passion to learn `R` didn’t wane. Over time, I’ve come to see how much the way you’re introduced to `R` shapes your experience, especially if you’re used to point-and-click software (GUIs) and are now stepping into the world of command-line interfaces (CLIs) and scripting.\n\nThat’s why, after navigating my own struggles, I decided to write this comprehensive guide. It’s meant for absolute beginners (and if the term ‘absolute beginner’ feels a *little* harsh, I apologize—but it answers the question: Who is this for?). I hope it will also help those who already have some `R` experience but feel like they missed out on key concepts during their own introductions to the language.\n\nI won’t promise that you’ll become an `R` programming guru overnight after reading this guide, but by the end of it, you should be able to:\n\n-   Install `R` and set up an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to work in.\n\n-   Run R commands and use the language with confidence.\n\n-   Load and utilize `R` packages effectively.\n\n-   Import data into the `R` environment.\n\n-   Clean and manipulate data for more efficient analysis.\n\n-   Understand basic data types and structures in `R`e.g., vectors, lists, and data frames.\n\n-   Write your own R functions and scripts.\n\n-   Use the power of `R` to perform some basic statistical analysis and data-processing tasks.\n\n-   Appreciate the meaning of the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninvisible(\n  lapply(\n    pkgs,\n    library\n  )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   Create beautiful graphs and visualizations to bring your data to life.\n\n-   Know where to find additional help and resources to improve your `R` coding skills.\n\n::: callout-tip\nTo make this post more interactive, I’ve enabled code execution right here within the post, so you don’t necessarily have to copy and paste it into your own IDE. You can run the code directly within the post, thanks to the [quarto-webR](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr) extension! I'll explain more about this later on.\n:::\n\n## Overview of `R`\n\n### ***What is `R`?***\n\nAt first glance, \"What is `R`?\" may seem like a simple question, but as @zuur2009; point out, it’s not so easily answered—and I agree. Broadly defined, `R` is a computer language that allows users to program algorithms and use tools that others have developed. This is a fairly generalized description and could apply to the plethora of programming languages, but `R` stands out because it’s often defined as a powerful environment specifically designed for statistical computing and graphics—or more simply, a statistical programming language.\n\nIt was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman as a free software environment for teaching, while they were colleagues at the University of Auckland in New Zealand [@vries2012a]. Their goal was to create an intuitive system for statistical computing and data visualization—something that statisticians across the world could adopt with ease. Given its origins, `R` is exceptionally well-suited for data science, a vital field in today’s world— developed by statisticians for statisticians. In fact, `R` is often referred to as the \"lingua franca of statistics\" among statisticians and scientists.\n\nA more practical way to understand `R`, however, is by looking at what it can *do*. As I’ve often told colleagues and friends, “**`R`** can do anything you can imagine,” and that’s hardly an exaggeration. With `R`, you can:\n\n-   Write custom functions and perform calculations\n\n-   Apply nearly every available statistical technique\n\n-   Generate everything from simple to highly complex graphs\n\n-   Perform geocomputation and geostatistics [@lovelace2019b]\n\n-   Create stunning 3D visualizations [@rayshader]\n\n-   Develop your own libraries of reusable functions\n\nPerhaps one of the most significant, nontrivial reasons for its widespread use is that `R` is free of charge, supported by a vast, active user community.\n\n*So Why Isn’t Everyone Using `R`?*\n\nThis question is easier to answer: `R` has a notoriously steep learning curve. Since it relies heavily on programming, even though there are graphical user interfaces (GUIs) available, none are advanced enough to fully eliminate the need for coding. But once you get the hang of `R`, I reckon you’ll find it hard to return to any other software for statistical computing.\n\nFrom my own experience—and from hearing others share theirs—learning both `R` and statistics simultaneously can feel overwhelming, like climbing two steep hills at once. @zuur2009, also acknowledge this issue, noting that when `R` is taught alongside statistics, many learners tend to focus on simply getting the `R` code to run, and often overlooking the weightier statistical concepts behind it. I faced the same struggle when I was first introduced to `R`.\n\nThat’s why this post focuses primarily on providing basic R instructions and not diving too deeply into statistics. However, I will demonstrate some fundamental statistical procedures you can perform in R later in the post. If your goal is to learn both R and statistics, this guide will provide the foundation you need to master R, equipping you with the skills to explore its powerful statistical tools and the vast range of packages that extend its capabilities.\n\n### ***Historical Background of `R`***\n\n`R` is a modern implementation, or dialect, of an earlier programming language called [S](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-21856-4) [@becker2018]. It also incorporates lexical scoping semantics inspired by [Scheme](https://www.scheme.org/) The development of `R` began in 1991, when Professors Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, recognized the need for a better software environment for their Macintosh teaching laboratory. Their journey into developing `R` is detailed in a 1996 paper in the *Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics* [@ihaka1996].\n\nThe name \"`R`\" is a nod to both the first names of its authors (Ross and Robert) and a playful reference to its predecessor, [S](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-21856-4). By 1993, after they had made significant progress, Ihaka and Gentleman began to share their work more widely, distributing binary copies of `R` through the StatLib data archive and announcing it on the *s-news* mailing list.\n\nInterest in `R` quickly grew, and many began to collaborate with the duo—most notably, Martin Mächler from ETH Zurich. In June 1995, Mächler convinced Ihaka and Gentleman to release `R` as free and open-source software under the terms of the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.gnu.org/)'s [GNU General Public License](https://www.r-project.org/COPYING), allowing anyone to use and modify it freely. Initially, bug reports were sent via email, but as interest surged, it became clear that manually maintaining communication was unsustainable. In response, in March 1996, Mächler volunteered the facilities at ETH Zurich to set up the *r-testers* mailing list, which allowed for automated discussions about `R` and its development.\n\nApproximately a year later, *r-testers* was replaced by three newsgroups: *R-announce*, *R-help*, and *R-devel*. Over time, more mailing lists were added to accommodate the growing community. Currently, the `R` project maintains five general mailing lists, including *R-package-devel* and *R-packages*, which can be found at <https://www.r-project.org/mail.html>.\n\nToday, the R Core Team—a group of currently 18 active individuals—has write access to the `R` source code (<https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html>), guiding its ongoing development. Many others have also contributed through new code submissions and bug fixes, making R a true collaborative effort. For those interested in a more detailed account of R’s development, Ross Ihaka provides a fascinating overview, available at [http:// cran.r‐project.org/doc/html/ interface98‐paper/paper.html](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/html/interface98-paper/paper.html).\n\nThe *Comprehensive R Archive Network* ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)) was officially launched on 23 April 1997, providing a centralized platform to store R’s executable files, source code, documentation, and packages. Over time, [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) has grown into one of the most extensive repositories for data science tools. In April 2003, the [R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/) was founded as a non-profit organization to provide long-term support for `R`’s continued development, ensuring that it remains a leading tool for statistical computing and data visualization.\n\nSince its humble beginnings, `R` has grown into a global force in statistical computing and data science. Thanks to its open-source nature and a thriving community, it remains one of the most widely used and rapidly evolving tools for data analysis. As the field of data science expands, `R`’s importance continues to grow, cementing its place as an indispensable resource for statisticians, data scientists, and researchers alike.\n\n## Getting Started With `R` Programming\n\nEvery journey begins with gathering the right tools, and your adventure into `R` programming is no different. The first essential step for any `R` novice is setting up the environment to start coding. Essentially, you have two main options:\n\n1.  **Install [R](https://www.r-project.org/ \"R\") and an IDE such as [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/ \"RStudio\"), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron)**\n\n2.  **Run R in a browser,** for example, via [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/ \"RStudio Cloud\"). Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, I’ve enabled live code execution right here within the post, so you don’t need to copy and paste it into your own IDE. You can run the code directly within the post, courtesy of the [quarto-webR](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr) extension.\n\nWhile installing [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/ \"R\") along with an IDE like [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/ \"RStudio\"), [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/)or [**Positron**](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron) requires a little more time and effort, it offers a more robust setup—allowing offline work and leveraging your computer’s CPU—I highly recommend this approach, especially for those committed to diving deep into `R`. However, if you're just exploring or testing the waters, running `R` online through platforms like [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/ \"RStudio Cloud\") may be more convenient (provided you have a reliable internet connection).\n\nWhichever path you choose, this post is designed to accommodate you. Whether you install `R` locally or use an online platform, the examples and instructions provided here will guide you seamlessly through your `R` programming journey.\n\n### *Downloading and Installing `R`*\n\nNow that we’ve covered an overview of R and some of its history, it's time to get your own copy of R so you can start using it. The easiest way to do this is by downloading a precompiled binary distribution of R, which includes the base system and contributed packages, and installing it on your computer. While it's also possible to install [R from source](https://docs.posit.co/resources/install-r-source.html), this is more complex and generally not necessary for most users. I recommend sticking to the precompiled binaries, which are easy to install and are available for a range of operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. In this guide, we’ll focus on installing R on Windows and macOS.\n\n#### Installing R on Windows\n\nInstalling R on Windows is a straightforward process. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1.  **Go to the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) website**: Visit the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at <https://cran.r-project.org/>.\n\n2.  **Download R for Windows**: Click on the \"Download R for Windows\" link.\n\n3.  **Download the base system**: On the next page, click \"base\" or \"Install R for the first time\" to download the R executable file (e.g., `R-4.x.x-win.exe`).\n\n4.  **Run the R installer**: Once downloaded, double-click the executable file to start the installation process. You may be prompted to allow the application to make changes to your device—click \"Yes\" to continue.\n\n5.  **Select installation language**: The installer will first prompt you to select the installation language. Choose your preferred language and click \"OK\".\n\n![](images/1-select_language.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n6.  **License agreement**: You’ll see a window with the GNU General Public License information. Simply click \"Next\".\n\n![](images/2-license.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n7.  **Choose the destination location**: By default, R will install in `C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-4.x.x`. Unless you have a specific reason to change it, I recommend leaving this as is and clicking \"Next\".\n\n![](images/3-directory.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n8.  **Select components**: In the \"Select Components\" window, the default options should suffice for most users, so just click \"Next\".\n\n![](images/4-components.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n9.  **Startup options**: Again, leave the default startup options selected and click \"Next\".\n\n![](images/5-startup_options.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n10. **Select Start Menu folder**: The default Start Menu folder is fine, so just click \"Next\" here as well.\n\n![](images/6-start_menu.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n11. **Additional tasks**: The installer will ask if you'd like to create desktop shortcuts or add `R` to your system PATH. The default options are usually best, so leave them checked and click \"Next\".\n\n![](images/7-additional_tasks.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n12. **Begin installation**: After confirming all the settings, click \"Next\" to start the installation process.\n\n![](images/8-installing.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n13. **Complete installation**: Once the installation is complete, click \"Finish\" to close the installer.\n\n![](images/9-completed.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nCongratulations, you've successfully installed `R` on your Windows system!\n\n#### Installing `R` on macOS\n\nThe installation process for macOS is very similar to that of Windows, but with a few differences in file format. Follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Go to the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) website**: Head over to <https://cran.r-project.org/>.\n\n2.  **Download `R` for macOS**: Click on \"Download R for macOS\".\n\n3.  **Choose the latest release**: In the \"Latest release\" section, download the appropriate version of `R` for your macOS system.\n\n![](images/11-download_r_mac.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n4.  **Open the installer**: Once the download is complete, double-click the `.pkg` installer file to open it.\n\n5.  **Follow the installation prompts**: Click \"Continue\" and proceed through the installer by following the on-screen instructions.\n\n6.  **Complete installation**: Once the installation process finishes, click \"Close\" to exit the installer.\n\nYou now have `R` installed on your macOS system!\n\nWith these steps completed, you’re ready to start programming in `R`! Next, we’ll move on to setting up a suitable Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to enhance your experience with `R`.\n\n### *Exploring IDE Options for `R`: Elevate Your `R` Programming with RStudio, VS Code, or Positron*\n\n#### Getting Started With the `R` Interface\n\nWhen working with `R`, several user interfaces (UIs) are available, but every installation of `R` includes a basic/standard interface— sometimes called the \"R Console.\" While you may eventually prefer using an advanced IDE like RStudio, it's important to familiarize yourself with this standard interface. Not only can it be helpful when using a machine without your preferred or favorite interfaces, but it also serves as a good foundation for understanding how other interfaces are organized. You may even come to appreciate and enjoy the simplicity of the standard interface.\n\nWhat follows is a practical guide on using the `RGUI`, which is the standard graphical interface for `R` on Windows platforms.\n\nOn Windows, `R` is typically installed in **`C:\\Program Files\\R`**, and you can access it from the Start menu under the `R` group. If, during installation, you selected \"Create a desktop shortcut,\" you’ll also have an `RGUI` icon on your desktop. To launch `R`, simply double-click this icon, and you’ll be greeted by a user interface that looks something like this:\n\n![](images/13-rgui.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nWhen opened, the main window, labeled \"R Console,\" will appear. This is where you will enter and execute your `R` commands. You can type commands directly into the Console and see the output immediately. This is also where error messages appear, . Keep in mind, closing the Console will end your `R` session.\n\nThe main window of `RGUI` is the \"R Console,\" which automatically opens when you launch `R`. This Console is where you enter `R` commands one at a time. Depending on the command, the output will be displayed in the Console, and this is also where any error messages will appear. The Console is unique and it's the primary space for interacting with `R`—keep in mind, closing the Console will end your `R` session.\n\n::: callout-note\n## **Isn’t `R` a Language?**\n\nYou might hear me refer to `R` as if it were a person, saying things like “Tell `R` to do this” or “Tell `R` to do that.” But, of course, `R` can’t *do* anything—it’s just a language. This is simply shorthand for saying, “Instruct your computer to perform a task by writing a command in the `R` language in the R console.” It’s your computer, not `R` itself, that does the heavy lifting.\n\nIs this shorthand a bit imprecise and lazy? Yes. But does everyone still use it? Absolutely—because it's convenient and saves time!\n:::\n\nFor new users, the easiest way to save the Console’s contents is to navigate to **File** → **Save to file** from the menu. However, note that the Console only retains the last few thousand lines written to it, so it's wise to save important work elsewhere. You may also find it helpful to clear the Console to start fresh. To do this, simply press `Ctrl + L` or select **Edit** → **Clear console** from the menu.\n\n*Ready to Write Your First Program in `R`?*\n\nNow that we have `R` installed and running, let’s dive right in by writing our first simple computer program. To do this, open `R` (if it’s not already open), and in the \"R Console\" type the following code after the `>` prompt symbol, then press **Enter**:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nAfter pressing **Enter**, you should see the following output appear in the Console, as shown in the image below.\n\n![](images/14-hello_world.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nCongratulations!—you’ve just written a computer program! A computer program is simply a sequence of instructions that perform a specific task when executed by the computer. The \"Hello, World!\" program is a classic way to introduce novice programmers to a new language. It serves two purposes: demonstrating the basic syntax of the language and verifying that the installation was successful, ensuring you know how to use it. In this case, the program consists of just one instruction—the command to display the text \"Hello, World!\" in the console. The command responsible for this is `print()`.\n\n*A couple of things to note about your first program:*\n\n-   **\"Hello, World!\" is a *string***: A string is a way of representing text in a computer program. In `R`, a string must be enclosed in quotes (`' '` or `\" \"`), which act as delimiters, signaling where the string starts and ends. The text inside the quotes—`Hello, World!`—is the actual string.\n\n-   **`print` is a *function***: Just like in mathematics, a function in `R` takes input, performs an operation, and returns output. The `print` function’s job is to take its input (in this case, the string `\"Hello, World!\"`) and display it in the console in a readable format.\n\n-   **Calling a function**: To execute the function, you need to \"call\" it, which is done by following the function name (`print`) with a pair of parentheses. The input to the function, in this case, the string, goes inside the parentheses. The parentheses are important as they tell `R` where the input starts and ends, serving as another type of delimiter.\n\nLet’s try another simple program with a basic arithmetic calculation—yes, `R` can function like a calculator. You can:\n\n-   Add numbers with `+`\n\n-   Subtract with `-`\n\n-   Multiply with `*`\n\n-   Divide with `/`\n\n-   Raise numbers to a power with `^`\n\nType the following code into the console and press **Enter**:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(4 + 2)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAfter pressing **Enter**, you should see the following output in the console:\n\n![](images/15-arithmetic_program.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nSo far, we've been using the `print()` function to display output. However, you can actually get output in the console without explicitly calling `print()`. You don’t always need the `print()` function for simple outputs. Typing just the expression will display the result:. For example, suppose you type:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n\"Hello, World!\"\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn the console, you’ll see the following result:\n\n![](images/16-Hello_world_2.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nSimilarly, you can try:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2 + 2\n```\n:::\n\n\nwith the output:\n\n![](images/17-arithmetic_program_2.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n::: callout-important\n## **Read-Evaluate-Print Loop (REPL)**\n\nSo far, you’ve been using `R` in what computer scientists call *interactive mode*. This means you type a command into the console, R immediately reads it, evaluates it, and prints the result back to the console for you to see. Then, you type the next command, and the process repeats. This cycle is known as the *Read-Evaluate-Print Loop*, or REPL for short.\n\n`R`, like other interactive languages, excels at providing immediate feedback, which makes it especially useful for statisticians and data analysts who often run small procedures, check results, and refine their approach iteratively—after all, R was originally designed by statisticians, for statisticians. As beginners, the REPL offers a fantastic way to observe `R`’s behavior and receive instant feedback on the simple programs we’re writing, helping us quickly understand how R processes our commands.\n:::\n\n::: callout-tip\n## **When Do We Compile?**\n\nIn some languages, like C, Java, or FORTRAN, you need to *compile* your human-readable code into machine-readable code (typically in the form of 1s and 0s) before it can be executed. If you've worked with those languages before, you might wonder whether you need to compile your R code too. The answer is no—R is a dynamic programming language, meaning it automatically *interprets* your code on the fly as you run it, without the need for a separate compilation step.\n:::\n\n*The \"R Editor\" Window:*\n\nFor more complex programs, you'll want to work in the \"R Editor,\" where you can write and edit multiple lines of code. When you're ready to move beyond typing and executing commands one by one, you can use the \"R Editor\" window to write and manage scripts efficiently. To open a blank editor, click **File** → **New Script** from the menu. If you have an existing script, select **File** → **Open Script** to continue working on it. The image below shows a new blank \"R Editor\" window.\n\n![](images/18-R_editor.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nYou can have multiple \"R Editor\" windows open simultaneously, allowing you to work on different scripts side by side.\n\n::: callout-note\nThe available menus and toolbar options change based on which window is currently in focus. In the image above, the focus has shifted from the \"R Console\" to the \"R Editor,\" which is why the toolbar and menu options have updated accordingly.\n:::\n\nAs expected, the script editor allows you to run commands either individually or in groups. You can also execute part of an expression by highlighting the code and pressing `Ctrl + R` (or using the \"Run line or selection\" button in the toolbar, or clicking **Edit** → **Run line or selection** from the menu).\n\n-   To run a single line of code, place the cursor within the line you want to execute and press `Ctrl + R`. Note that one line may not always be a complete executable statement.\n\n-   To run a specific section of code, highlight the desired text and press `Ctrl + R`. The highlighted text can span multiple lines or just part of one.\n\n-   To run the entire script, highlight everything using `Ctrl + A` and then press `Ctrl + R`.\n\nYou can save your script anytime by pressing `Ctrl + S` or selecting **File** → **Save**.\n\n*The \"R Graphics\" Window:*\n\nWhen you utilize a function such as `plot()` to create a graphic, the graphics window—commonly referred to as the \"device\"—serves as the default output area. If a graphics window is not already open, a new one is produced, otherwise the existing window is reused.\n\nTo illustrate this, let’s plot a graph using a built-in dataset called **`pressure`**. The dataset, which comes pre-installed with `R`, shows the relationship between temperature (in degrees Celsius) and vapor pressure of mercury (measured in millimeters). Below, we apply the `plot()` function to the pressure dataset and execute it from the \"R Editor\":\n\n![](images/19-R_graphics.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nTo open a new graphics window without closing an existing one, you can use the `dev.new()` function. This allows you to create multiple graphics windows for your visualizations. To save a graphic, simply click **File** → **Save As** and select your desired format from the menu.\n\n*The \"Data Editor\" Window:*\n\nThe simplest way to examine the contents of a basic data object is by printing it directly to the Console. Just type the object's name at the command prompt.\n\nTo explore the data within a data frame or matrix, you can use either `fix(dataframe)` or `View(dataframe)`, where \"dataframe\" refers to the name of your data object. These functions are specifically for data frames and matrices. The `fix()` function allows you to modify the data, while `View()` only displays it without editing capabilities. Alternatively, you can navigate to **Edit** → **Data Editor** in the menu and specify the name of the data frame or matrix you wish to edit.\n\nAs an example, let's view the **pressure** dataset we used earlier to plot the graph. You can use the following command:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfix(pressure)\n```\n:::\n\n\n![](images/20-R_data_editor.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nThis will open the data frame in a tab where you can inspect it interactively.\n\nAny changes you make using the Data Editor are automatically saved to your workspace (you’ll learn more about saving the workspace later). However, while the Data Editor is open, you cannot run any other code, and files cannot be saved directly from this window.\n\n*The \"R History\" Window:*\n\nYou can access your command history by using the `history()` function, which opens a window displaying your most recent commands. By default, this shows the last 25 lines of code you've submitted. Below is an example of what my current history looks like.\n\n![](images/21-history.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nTo save the contents of this history window, you can either click **File** → **Save to file** in the menu or use the `savehistory()` function directly in the Console. This allows you to preserve your previous commands for future reference or reuse.\n\n*Saving the Workspace*\n\nR stores the data and objects you're working with in an area of your computer's memory called the \"workspace.\" While the standard R interface doesn't have a dedicated window to display these objects, you can easily list them in the Console by using the `ls()` function. These objects can include data imported from external sources (such as text files), new data you've generated, results from expressions you've executed, and various other elements.\n\nWhen you shut down R, it will typically prompt you to save your workspace. If you choose to save it under the default name `.RData` (note that it's just the file extension with no filename), `R` will automatically load this workspace the next time you launch it.\n\nFor substantial work, it's generally considered good practice to save your raw data sources and a script that recreates your data objects. This ensures that you—or anyone else—can fully reproduce your analysis. From this perspective, it's often unnecessary to save the workspace itself.\n\nHowever, if your work involves lengthy data processing or a complex script, saving the workspace can be useful as it provides a convenient starting point for your next session, saving time and effort.\n\nTo save your workspace, either click **File** → **Save workspace** in the menu, or use the `save.image()` function in the Console. If you want to save it under a specific filename, use `save(file = \"filename\")`. You can load a previously saved workspace by running `load(file = \"filename\")`.\n\nSo far, we’ve successfully interacted with base `R`—we’ve written our first \"Hello, World!\" program, performed basic arithmetic, and even plotted a graph (how cool is that?). While `RGUI` is functional, it can feel somewhat basic and limited compared to modern integrated development environments (IDEs), which offer enhanced features for coding, debugging, and data visualization. In the next section, we will explore the powerful capabilities provided by IDEs.\n\n#### RStudio IDE for `R` and Python\n\nOne of the most popular ways to interface with `R`, beyond the basic `RGUI`, is through RStudio, a powerful Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed primarily for `R`. RStudio offers an intuitive and interactive environment, making coding, data analysis, and project management significantly easier. However, it’s important to note that before using RStudio, you must first install `R` on your computer.\n\nAccording to RStudio’s mission statement:\n\n> *“To create free and open-source software for data science, scientific research, and technical communication. We do this to enhance the production and consumption of knowledge by everyone, regardless of economic means, and to facilitate collaboration and reproducible research, both of which are critical to the integrity and efficacy of work in science, education, government, and industry.”*\n\nRStudio was founded by J.J. Allaire, a software engineer and entrepreneur, in 2009, with the first version of RStudio IDE released in 2011. Since its release, RStudio has become a go-to tool for data scientists, researchers, and statisticians worldwide.\n\nWhile RStudio is mainly known for its support of `R`, it also accommodates other programming languages, such as Python, SQL, and even Stan for Bayesian statistics. This flexibility makes RStudio a multifunctional open-source IDE that is widely adopted for various programming and data analysis needs. RStudio works best with `R` versions `3.0.1` and higher, ensuring compatibility with most modern workflows.\n\n1.  **Go to the official [RStudio website](https://rstudio.com)** and click on `DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO` at the top-right corner of the homepage.\n\n2.  **Install `R` first**, if you haven’t already, by downloading the appropriate version for your operating system. Since this step is covered under \\[Downloading and Installing R\\], you can proceed directly to installing RStudio.\n\n3.  **Download RStudio Desktop**: On the download page, select `RStudio Desktop` for your operating system—Windows, macOS, or Linux. RStudio will automatically recommend the appropriate version for your machine.\n\n4.  **Run the installer**:\n\n    -   For Windows, this is a `.exe` file.\n\n    -   For macOS, it is a `.dmg` file.\n\n    Simply run the installer and follow the prompts.\n\n![](images/22-R_studio.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nIt's recommended to keep the default settings during installation.\n\n![](images/23-R_studio_finish.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n5.  **Launch RStudio**: Once installed, you can launch RStudio directly. There’s no need to open the base `R` application separately. RStudio automatically integrates with `R`, giving you a more advanced interface and additional tools for your projects.\n6.  **Complete the installation**: Once you finish installing RStudio, you’re ready to start coding. Your IDE is now linked to your R installation, so from this point forward, you only need to open RStudio to access `R`.\n\nCongratulations! You are now all set to begin working with `R` through the RStudio IDE.\n\n::: callout-important\n## **Do I Still Need to Download `R`?**\n\nYes, even if you plan to use RStudio, you’ll still need to download and install `R` on your computer. RStudio acts as an interface that helps you work with `R`, but it doesn’t include `R` itself. It relies on the version of R that’s installed locally on your system.\n:::\n\nBefore diving into coding, it’s worth spending a few moments customizing RStudio to enhance your experience (trust me, it makes a difference). To access the settings, follow these steps:\n\n-   On a Mac, go to **Tools** → **Global Options** or simply press `⌘ + ,`.\n\n-   On a Windows computer, head to **Tools** → **Global Options** or press `Ctrl + ,`.\n\nHere are a few key adjustments I recommend to set yourself up for success right from the start:\n\n1.  **Code Formatting:** In the **Code** → **Editing** tab, make sure to enable at least the first five options, especially “Auto-indent code after paste.” This feature helps maintain clean, organized code by automatically indenting after pasting, making your scripts easier to read and maintain. Proper indentation isn't just aesthetic—it also ensures clarity, especially in longer and more complex code.\n\n2.  **Display Settings:** In the **Display** tab, consider enabling the first three options. Particularly, “Highlight selected line” can be a lifesaver in longer scripts, as it allows you to easily spot where your cursor is. This feature helps avoid confusion when navigating through multiple lines of code.\n\n3.  **Appearance and Customization:** Personalizing your workspace can make coding more enjoyable and visually comfortable. The most noticeable change you can make is under the **Appearance** section, where you can choose a color theme for RStudio. Explore the different themes and see what fits your style—there’s no right or wrong here! One preference I always recommend is adjusting the **Editor Theme**. I like using a dark theme for better visibility and reduced eye strain during long coding sessions. My go-to is **Solarized Dark**, but feel free to pick whichever theme suits you best.\n\nTo change the Editor Theme:\n\n-   Navigate to **Tools → Global Options**, and under **Appearance**, select the theme that resonates with you.\n\n![](images/26-RStudio_appearance.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nThese small tweaks can make a big difference in your overall RStudio experience, giving you a smoother, more comfortable environment as you embark on your R programming journey.\n\n##### The RStudio Interface\n\nThe RStudio interface is divided into four quadrants, each serving a specific function:\n\n-   The **`Console`** window,\n\n-   The **`Source`** window,\n\n-   The **`Environment | History | Connections | Tutorial`** window, and\n\n-   The **`Files | Plots | Packages | Help | Viewer`** window\n\n![](images/27-Rstudio_panes.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nWhile you can customize the layout of the panes in the RStudio interface, I personally prefer the default arrangement. To change the pane layout, go to **Tools** → **Global Options**. Under **Global Options**, select the **Pane Layout** option and adjust the panes to your liking.\n\nYou may notice that sometimes the Source window isn't visible when you first open RStudio. This happens when there’s no file opened. To activate the Source window, either open an existing file or create a new one by selecting `File → New File → R Script` from the menu bar, or by using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + N` on Windows or `Cmd + Shift + N` on Mac.\n\nNow, let's briefly explore the purpose of each pane and how they contribute to your workflow in `R`.\n\n###### The **`Console`** Window\n\nThe **Console** is located in the bottom-left pane of RStudio. It serves as the space where you see the output of your code and computations, much like the \"R Console\" window in base R. You can also write and execute code directly in the Console, as we did in base R earlier. Let’s try a quick example by calculating the sum of `20 + 7`. Click into the Console, type the following, and press `Enter/Return ↵` on your keyboard. The result should be straightforward:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# We type this directly into the console:\n20 + 7\n```\n:::\n\n\nHere's an example of how it should appear in your RStudio Console:\n\n![](images/28-RStudio_Console.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nIn the top-right corner of the Console pane, you'll notice a broom icon. This is an important feature for clearing the Console when it gets too cluttered. If you want to remove all the text in the Console, simply click the broom icon. Alternatively, you can use the handy keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + L` on both Windows and Mac for the same purpose. If you prefer using code, the following commands can also clear the Console:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# On Windows:\nshell(\"cls\")\n\n# or\ncat(\"\\014\") \n\n# On Linux or macOS:\nshell(\"clear\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n###### The **`source`** Window\n\nLocated in the top-left pane of RStudio, the **Source Window** serves as a versatile space for managing various types of files, including data, programming code, and notes. The term \"source\" encompasses any file you wish to work with. The Source panel can fulfill multiple functions, such as:\n\n-   **Inspecting Data:** View datasets in an Excel-like format for easier analysis.\n\n-   **Opening R Scripts:** Load and edit R scripts for your projects.\n\n-   **Handling Other Text-Based Formats:** Open a variety of file types, including:\n\n    -   Plain text files (.txt)\n\n    -   Markdown files (.md)\n\n    -   HTML documents (.html)\n\n    -   LaTeX files (.tex)\n\n    -   BibTeX files (.bib)\n\n-   **Editing Scripts:** Write and modify code directly within the Source window.\n\n-   **Running Analyses:** Execute the code you've written to analyze data or generate results.\n\n![](images/29-RStudio_source.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nIn essence, the Source window provides a workspace for any text-based file that RStudio can read. However, it's important to note that Microsoft Office documents and non-text files (like images) are not supported in this pane. This limitation emphasizes the focus on coding and text editing within the Source window.\n\n###### The **`Environment | History | Connections | Tutorial`** window\n\nThe window in the top right of RStudio consists of multiple panes, each serving a distinct purpose. The **`Environment`** pane displays the objects available for computation within your R session. One of the first objects you will create is your dataset, as data is fundamental to any analysis. In addition to datasets, you might also encounter plots, lists, vectors, and functions you’ve created yourself. Don’t worry if these terms are unfamiliar at this stage; we will explore each of them in detail in the upcoming sections. For now, remember that this pane is where you can view and manage the various objects you create during your work.\n\n![](images/30-RStudio_Environment.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nThe **`History`** pane provides a log of all computations you’ve executed in the console. This feature allows you to revisit previous commands and easily rerun them. For example, if you computed the sum of `20 + 7`, this entry will be stored in your history. You can quickly insert this command back into the console by clicking on it in the History pane and selecting **To Console**. This action will paste `20 + 7` back into the console, allowing you to hit `Return ↵` to retrieve the result. Alternatively, you can copy the command into an existing or new R Script by clicking on **To Source**, enabling you to save and reuse it later. If you want to preserve your command history, you can click on the floppy disk icon to save it. Additionally, you can delete individual entries using the button with a white page and red circle, or clear the entire history using the broom icon (note that this action is irreversible).\n\n![](images/31-RStudio_History.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nThe **`Connections`** pane enables you to connect to external databases directly, which can be particularly useful for collaborative work or when handling large datasets without needing to download them. However, for an introductory exploration of R, we won’t be utilizing this feature of RStudio.\n\n![](images/32-RStudio_Connections.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nLastly, the **Tutorial** pane offers access to additional resources for learning `R` and RStudio. This section serves as an excellent starting point if you’re looking for more materials to enhance your understanding of `R` programming.\n\n![](images/33-RStudio_Tutorial.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n###### The **`Files | Plots | Packages | Help | Viewer`** window\n\nThis final window contains five essential panes, each serving a unique function to enhance your workflow.\n\nAs the name suggests, the **`Files`** pane lists all the files and folders in your root directory—the default location where RStudio saves your files, such as analyses and data. This pane provides an easy way to manage files within RStudio, load datasets, and create folders to keep your projects organized. Later on, we will delve into how to properly set up and manage projects in RStudio. For now, think of the Files pane as a simple way to navigate your working directory, which keeps all elements of your research accessible and organized.\n\n![](images/34-RStudio_Files.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nSince the Console cannot display visualizations, RStudio offers the **Plots** pane—equivalent to the \"R Graphics\" window in base R—to render and display any graphs or charts you create. This pane is specifically designed for visual output. Let’s walk through a quick example; type the following code into your Console to generate a simple boxplot:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# This creates a basic boxplot using the 'mtcars' dataset\nboxplot(mtcars$hp)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `mtcars` dataset comes pre-installed with R, and in this case, we are using the `boxplot()` function to visualize the distribution of the `hp` (horsepower) variable. The resulting plot will automatically appear in your Plots pane.\n\n![](images/35-RStudio_Plots.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nYou can navigate through multiple plots by using the arrow buttons in this pane. To delete the current plot, click on the `red circle with a white 'x'`, or clear all plots by using the `broom` icon. You can also export your plot for use in presentations or reports, with options for saving it as an image file or PDF.\n\nThe **`Packages`** pane manages the additional tools (called packages) that you can install and use to extend R’s functionality. Think of packages as apps for your phone—they add extra features, whether that’s creating animated plots, applying advanced machine learning algorithms, or simplifying repetitive tasks. By default, `R` comes with a set of basic packages, but you can easily install and load additional ones for your specific analysis needs. In this pane, you can see a list of installed packages.\n\n![](images/36-RStudio_Packages.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nThe **`Help`** pane is your go-to resource for any questions you have while coding in `R`.\n\n![](images/37a-RStudio_Help1.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nWhether you need clarification on a function or want to learn about datasets included in `R`, this pane offers thorough documentation. For instance, if you want to explore details about the `mtcars` dataset used earlier, simply type the following command into the Console:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Type a '?' followed by the name of a dataset/function/etc.\n# to look up helpful information about it.\n?mtcars\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis will open the Help pane and provide comprehensive information about the dataset.\n\n![](images/37b-RStudio_Help2.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nYou can search for specific topics or browse through various help pages. For additional learning, I highly recommend CRAN’s '[Getting Help with R](https://www.r-project.org/help.html)' webpage. And if you're ever stuck, don’t hesitate to expand your search to other resources, such as [Google](https://www.google.com/), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/home) (using [#RStats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats)).\n\nLastly, the **`Viewer`** pane is designed for more dynamic and interactive content that can’t be displayed in the static **`Plots`** pane. For example, if you're building web-based visualizations, dashboards, or even websites, the Viewer pane is where this content will appear. Most of these visualizations are based on HTML or other web technologies, allowing you to interact with your data in real-time. You can also view these outputs in your web browser for more flexibility. Although we primarily focus on static 2D plots in this guide, which are most useful for assignments, theses, or publications, it’s good to know that RStudio has the capacity to handle more complex and interactive visualizations.\n\n##### Working Directories and Starting your `R` Projects in RStudio\n\nOnce you’ve successfully installed R, a common challenge arises when you need to import data from your local drive or save output like plots back to your computer. You might find yourself asking, \"Where is my data located?\" or \"Where did R save my plot?\" This is where **working directories** come into play.\n\nIn simple terms, a working directory is a folder on your computer where R reads and writes files. When you first install R, it assigns a **default working directory**, which is usually the \"Documents\" folder on your system (`C:/Users/YourName/Documents` on Windows). This means that unless you specify otherwise, `R` will save your files or try to find your data in this default location.\n\nAs soon as R is installed and you start working with it, you might notice that several system files get created in the home directory (your \"Documents\" folder):\n\n-   **`.RData`**\n\n-   **`.Rhistory`**\n\n-   **`.Rprofile`**\n\n-   **`.Renviron`**\n\n**`.RData`:**\n\nThis file saves the current workspace, including all objects, variables, and functions you’ve defined in your R session. When you quit R, you may be prompted with the option to \"Save workspace image?\" If you choose to save, R will create or update the `.RData` file. The next time you open R in that directory, it will reload the objects saved in this file, restoring your previous session.\n\nWhile this file can be useful for quickly returning to a prior session, it may become cumbersome as your work evolves, so advanced users often turn off the automatic saving of `.RData` to avoid potential conflicts or confusion between sessions.\n\n::: callout-tip\nTo manage your R environment and ensure reproducibility across projects, it’s a good idea to adjust a few default settings in RStudio. Navigate to `Tools` → `Global Options`, and in the **General** tab under **Basic**, you’ll see options that start with `Restore`. While it may seem counter-intuitive at first not to restore everything as you left it, making these changes will greatly improve the reproducibility of your projects. Here’s what I recommend unchecking:\n\n-   **Restore most recently opened project at startup**\n\n-   **Restore previously open source documents at startup**\n\n-   **Restore .RData into workspace at startup**\n\nNext, in the same **General** tab under **Workspace**, set `Save workspace to .RData on exit` to **Never**. While it might seem useful to save your workspace between sessions, in practice, this can lead to unexpected issues down the line. Starting each session with a clean workspace minimizes confusion and ensures that your projects remain independent and reproducible.\n\nThese changes aren’t mandatory—you can always adjust them later once you better understand their importance. But implementing them early can save you many headaches as you progress in `R`.\n:::\n\n**`.Rhistory`:**\n\nThis file stores the history of all the commands you've entered in the R console. It allows you to recall past commands easily, making it a helpful tool for navigating through previous work. You can access your command history using the **`history()`** function or by scrolling through past commands using the up and down arrow keys.\n\n**`.Rprofile`:**\n\nThe `.Rprofile` file allows users to customize the behavior of `R` at startup. This file is written in `R` code and can contain settings and options to modify your `R` environment. For instance, you might use it to set a preferred working directory or automatically load packages you frequently use.\n\nThere are two levels of `.Rprofile` files:\n\n-   **User-level**: Found in your home directory (e.g., `~/.Rprofile`), it applies to all R sessions.\n\n-   **Project-level**: Located in specific project folders, it only applies to R sessions opened in that project.\n\nIf both user-level and project-level `.Rprofile` files exist, R will only source one, unless you explicitly include the user-level `.Rprofile` in the project-level file using:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsource(\"~/.Rprofile\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou can edit your `.Rprofile` using the function `usethis::edit_r_profile()` in R.\n\n**`.Renviron`:**\n\nSimilar to `.Rprofile`, the `.Renviron` file allows you to define **environment variables**. These variables can be used to store information like API keys or credentials that you don’t want to hard-code into your scripts for security reasons. The `.Renviron` file follows a simple key-value format:\n\n``` makefile\nKEY1=value1\nKEY2=value2\n```\n\nYou can retrieve environment variables during your R session using `Sys.getenv(\"KEY1\")`, which will return `\"value1\"`. Like `.Rprofile`, `.Renviron` can exist at both the user and project level, but only one will be sourced.\n\nTo edit your `.Renviron` file, you can use the `usethis::edit_r_environ()` function.\n\nThe current working directory is displayed by the RStudio IDE within the title region of the Console pane. You can also check your current working directory by running the command `getwd()` in the console to print it out.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngetwd()\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you’re not using RStudio Projects, you’ll need to manually set the working directory at the start of every R script using the `setwd()` function, like so:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsetwd(\"C:/Users/Elias Nelson Kaunda/Documents/Intro-to-R\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe code above sets the working directory to the \"`Intro-to-R`\" folder, meaning to say when loading data R will start looking from this directory.\n\nIn the code above, you're telling R to use the \"`Intro-to-R`\" folder as the working directory. Any files you read or save will be handled within this directory.\n\nHowever, there's a catch: **`setwd()` uses an absolute file path**, which is specific to your computer's directory structure. If you share your script with someone else or switch to a different computer, the path won’t work unless their folder structure matches yours exactly (you are unlikely to have a directory structure `\"C:/Users/Elias Nelson Kaunda/Documents/Intro-to-R\"` on your computer). This limits the portability and reproducibility of your project.\n\nRStudio provides a solution to this problem through **R Projects** (files with the `.Rproj` extension). Using RStudio projects eliminates so much of the early-stage hassle and confusion around reading in and exporting data. When you create an R Project, RStudio sets the working directory to the folder containing the project file. This allows you to use **relative paths** within the project, making it much easier to share your work and collaborate with others.\n\nFor example, if you need to send your analysis to a colleague, you can simply share the entire project folder. Your colleague can open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio, and any script that references files using relative paths will run smoothly—without needing to alter the working directory.R Projects offer several key benefits:\n\n-   **File Organization**: All the files you generate—data, scripts, plots, reports—are stored in the same folder. This keeps your work organized without the need to manually manage file locations.\n\n-   **Reproducibility**: Since R Projects use relative paths, sharing your project folder ensures that others can reproduce your analysis without needing to modify file paths.\n\n-   **Version Control**: R Projects integrate seamlessly with GitHub, allowing you to use version control to track changes to your code over time. This is especially useful for collaboration or when you need to roll back to a previous version of your analysis.\n\n-   **Convenience**: You don’t need to worry about setting the working directory manually. RStudio automatically uses the project folder as the root directory.\n\nHere’s how you can create a new R Project in RStudio:\n\n1.  Navigate to **File** → **New Project** from the menu bar\n\n![](images/38a-RStudio_project1.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nor click the drop-down arrow in the top-right corner and select **New Project**.\n\n![](images/38b-RStudio_project2.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n2.  In the pop-up window, select **New Directory**.\n\n![](images/39-RStudio_directory.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n3.  Next, choose **New Project**.\n\n![](images/40-RStudio_new_project.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n4.  Choose a clear, descriptive name for your project folder (referred to as the **Directory Name**) that reflects the nature of your work. Make sure to save this project folder in a logical and organized location on your computer. You can adjust the folder's location by clicking **Browse...** and selecting the appropriate directory. Ideally, this should be a folder where you routinely store your research or analysis projects, ensuring easy access and consistency in file management.\n\n![](images/43-RStudio_project.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n5.  Optionally, you can create a Git repository for version control by ticking the **Create a git repository** checkbox. If you’re unfamiliar with Git or don’t use GitHub, you can safely ignore this option for now.\n\n6.  Check the **Open in new session** option to open your new project in a fresh RStudio window.\n\n7.  Once you’re satisfied with the settings, click **Create Project**. RStudio will open a new session for your project, and you’re ready to begin.\n\n![](images/42-RStudio_project_open.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nOnce your project is set up, you’ll notice a few changes in RStudio:\n\n-   The project name will appear at the top of the RStudio window.\n\n-   The **Files** pane will show the root directory (i.e., your project folder), making it easy to navigate through your project files.\n\n-   The Console will display the current file path of your project.\n\nThis setup ensures that all your scripts, data, and output are stored together in one place. While you could configure all this manually using `setwd()`, R Projects make the process much more intuitive and efficient.\n\n##### Organizing Your `R` Projects and Structuring Your Working Directories\n\nThis section is not about the technical aspects of RStudio, R, or data analysis per se. Instead, it's about the often overlooked yet crucial habit of organizing your work through a solid folder structure. Like good coding practices, setting up a clear, logical folder structure can significantly boost your productivity and reduce frustration. A well-structured project directory will help you quickly locate files, avoid clutter, and make your work easier to share or revisit later. This is especially important when working with R projects in RStudio.\n\nBefore you start coding, take some time to plan your folder structure. Having dedicated folders for different file types, rather than dumping everything into one container, will save you time and prevent headaches down the line. Whether you create your folder structure within RStudio or through your file browser, the key is to be organized.\n\nGood folder organization also plays a critical role in reproducible research and analysis. Proper directory setup is one of the \"non-code\" aspects of R programming that significantly enhances your workflow, and for beginners, it should be a priority. Structuring your directories in a way that’s easy to navigate ensures that collaborators—or your future self—can follow and reproduce your work effortlessly.\n\n***A Basic Folder Structure:***\n\nAside from using RStudio projects, it’s also good practice to set up a working directory that makes your project easy to navigate. Here's a basic template you can use as a starting point:\n\n![](images/44-Project_template.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nFor each project I work on, I usually have at least the following folder structure:\n\n-   **Data**: This folder contains all the files you’ll need to import into R for analysis or visualization. These could include CSV, Excel, SPSS (`*.sav`), `.FST`, `.RDS`, `.tif`, `.shp`, or `.gpkg` files, depending on your work. It’s a good idea to create two separate subfolders: one for raw data (untouched, as collected or downloaded) and another for processed or cleaned data (after some wrangling and transformation in R). This ensures that you keep your original data intact while also organizing the processed data outputs.\n\n-   **R Scripts**: Here, you save all your R scripts. This includes your analysis code as well as any custom functions you may write. You might consider creating a subfolder specifically for your functions if you find it convenient to keep them separate. Saving your scripts and functions this way allows for easy re-use across different analyses and projects. Rather than creating separate projects for every analysis, you can store multiple scripts in one project folder—making it easier to manage different tasks on the same dataset.\n\n-   **Output**: Use this folder to store all the outputs generated from your scripts, such as plots, reports (e.g., HTML or PDF), and any data exports. This folder helps differentiate between input data and the final results, ensuring others (or you, in the future) can easily identify the outputs of your analysis.\n\nIn RStudio, your directory structure might look like this:\n\n![](images/45-Project_structure.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nThis template should serve as a good starting point if you’re new to project organization. However, remember that each project has its unique requirements. You should always adapt the directory structure to fit the specific needs of the project while maintaining a level of consistency that simplifies collaboration and future work.\n\n::: callout-note\nIt’s also a good practice to use **lowercase** for folder names, as shown in the example above. This makes it easier when you reference folder names in your code for reading or writing files, reducing potential errors related to case sensitivity.\n:::\n\nBy adopting this structure early on, you’ll streamline your workflow, improve the reproducibility of your work, and make it easier to share or revisit your projects with confidence.\n\n##### Creating R Scripts in RStudio\n\nCode quickly becomes long and complex. Thus, it is not very convenient to write it in the console. So, instead, we can write code into an R Script. Remember the \"R Editor\" window we encountered in the base `RGUI`—well the R Script in RStudio could be considered as it's equivalent, but much better. An `R` Script is a document that RStudio recognises as *R* programming code. Files that are not `R` Scripts, like `.txt`, `.rtf` or `.md`, can also be opened in RStudio, but any code written in it will not be automatically recognised.\n\nWhen opening an R script or creating a new one, it will display in the *Source* window. Some refer to this window as the ‘script editor’. An *R* script starts as an empty file. Good coding etiquette. demands that we use the first line to indicate what this file does by using a comment #. Here is an example for a [‘TidyTuesday’](https://www.tidytuesday.com/ \"'TidyTuesday'\") R Project.\n\nAll examples in this post can easily be copied and pasted into your own `R` script. Let’s try it with the following code. The plot this code creates reveals which car manufacturer produces the most efficient cars. Copy and paste this code into your `R` script.\n\n##### Updating R and RStudio: Staying on the Cutting Edge\n\nWhile regularly updating your software might not directly improve your programming skills, it can certainly save you from unnecessary frustration down the road. It’s important to remember that R and RStudio are separate programs, meaning you need to update them individually. Although they work closely together, updating RStudio won’t automatically update R itself, and vice versa.\n\nThis distinction becomes crucial when certain tools or packages you’ve installed through RStudio require the latest version of R. For instance, if you're using a cutting-edge machine learning algorithm that’s incompatible with older versions of R, you might run into errors or performance issues. Likewise, R packages developed by the community (which we’ll explore later) also need to be updated independently—they are not automatically refreshed when you update R or RStudio.\n\nNow, I know this sounds a bit tedious, but don’t worry—it’s simpler than it seems. Updating packages within RStudio is straightforward, and I’ll guide you through it. Just keep in mind: **`R`, RStudio, and your packages all need to be updated separately.**\n\nBy staying on top of updates, you’ll ensure that your coding environment remains compatible, efficient, and equipped with the latest features, sparing you the hassle of unexpected errors or incompatibility down the line.\n\n#### VS Code: IDE and Code Editor for Software Developers and Programming\n\n#### Positron: A New, Yet Familiar IDE for R and Python\n\n## \n",
