  “Many people tend to look at programming styles and languages like religions: if you belong to one, you cannot belong to others. But this analogy is another fallacy.” — Niklaus Wirth

  This blog is a growing compendium of musings on programming and data work—ranging from hands-on explorations in R to forays into other languages such as Python and Julia. It reflects a curiosity-driven approach to learning, where tools are chosen for their strengths, not their labels.
