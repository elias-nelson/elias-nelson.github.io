  <em>“Many people tend to look at programming styles and languages like religions: if you belong to one, you cannot belong to others. But this analogy is another fallacy.”</em> — Niklaus Wirth

  This blog is a growing compendium of musings on programming and data work—ranging from hands-on explorations in {{< iconify logos:r-lang >}} to forays into other languages such as {{< iconify logos:python >}} **Python** and {{< iconify logos:julia >}} . It reflects a curiosity-driven approach to learning, where tools are chosen for their strengths, not their labels.
